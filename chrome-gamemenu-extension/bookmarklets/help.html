Bookmarklets is a bookmark stored in a web browser that contains JavaScript commands that add new features to the browser. Bookmarklets are JavaScripts stored as the URL of a bookmark in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. Bookmarklets are usually small snippets of JavaScript executed when the users clicks on them. Regardless of whether bookmarklet utilities are stored as bookmarks or hyperlinks, they add one-click functions to a browser or web page. When clicked, a bookmarklet performs one of a wide variety of operations, such as running a search query or extracting data from a table. For example, clicking on a bookmarklet after selecting text on a webpage could run an Internet search on the selected text and display a search engine results page.

HOW TO ADD: Copy and paste the bookmarklet text into a bookmark URL on your bookmark bar (located under your URL box), and it will be added. You can right-click them and press "Edit" to change the bookmark name and URL.
